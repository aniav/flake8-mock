Flake8 Mock plugin
==================

Remember that a mock's job is to say, "You got it, boss" whenever anyone calls
it. It will do real work, like raising an exception, when one of its
convenience methods is called, like ``assert_called_once_with``. But it won't
do real work when you call a method that only *resembles* a convenience method,
such as ``assert_called_once`` (no ``_with``!). Sometimes developers may not
notice that they are using a non-existent mock method, because they are not
getting an output error telling them so. And for some reason they can also
forget to verify that the test cases fail before writing implementation code.

This plugin checks for possible non-existent mock methods when you run
``flake8``, the Python code checker.

Inspired by http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/02/assert_called_once-threat-or-menace.html.


Installation
------------

You can install or upgrade ``flake8-mock`` with these commands::

  $ pip install flake8-mock
  $ pip install --upgrade flake8-mock


Plugin for Flake8
-----------------

When both ``flake8 3.5.0`` and ``flake8-mock`` are installed, the plugin is
available in ``flake8``::

    $ flake8 --version
    3.5.0 (flake8-mock: 0.4, pyflakes: 0.8.1)


Example output
--------------

Once you run flake8, you can have something like::

    $ flake8 test_file.py
    test_file.py:55:5: M201 called_once is a non-existent mock property
    test_file.py:56:5: M200 called_once_with is a non-existent mock method
